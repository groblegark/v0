Create an implementation plan for the given instructions.

## Output

Write the plan to `plans/{name}.md`.

## Structure

1. **Overview** - Brief summary of what will be built
2. **Project Structure** - Directory layout and key files
3. **Dependencies** - External libraries or tools needed
4. **Implementation Phases** - Numbered phases with clear milestones
5. **Key Implementation Details** - Important algorithms, patterns, or decisions
6. **Verification Plan** - How to test the implementation

## Guidelines

- Break work into 3-6 phases
- Each phase should be independently verifiable
- Include code snippets for complex patterns
- Reference existing project files when relevant
- Keep phases focused and achievable
