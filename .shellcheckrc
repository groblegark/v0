# Default shell for scripts without shebang
shell=bash

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Disable checks that are commonly false positives in this codebase:
# SC2034: Unused variables (often intentional in library exports)
# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned (often sourced from other files)
# SC2310: set -e disabled in if condition (informational, by design)
# SC2311: set -e disabled in subshell (informational, by design)
# SC2312: Masked return value ($(date), $(basename) are safe)
# SC2129: Consider using { } >> file (style preference)
# SC2001: Use ${var//pattern/replace} instead of sed (not possible for multiline)
# SC2249: Consider adding default *) case (style, not required)
