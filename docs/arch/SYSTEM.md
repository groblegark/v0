# v0 System Architecture

This document describes the runtime architecture of v0: processes, directories, environment variables, and inter-process coordination.

## Workers and Processes

v0 runs several background workers, each with its own PID file for lifecycle management.

### Worker Types

| Worker | Command | PID File | Purpose |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Merge Queue** | `v0 mergeq --watch` | `${BUILD_DIR}/mergeq/.daemon.pid` | Serializes merges to develop branch |
| **Fix Worker** | `v0 fix --start` | `${BUILD_DIR}/fix/.daemon.pid` | Processes bug issues from wok |
| **Chore Worker** | `v0 chore --start` | `${BUILD_DIR}/chore/.daemon.pid` | Processes chore issues |
| **Nudge Daemon** | `v0 nudge daemon` | `${BUILD_DIR}/nudge/.daemon.pid` | Monitors idle tmux sessions |
| **Coffee** | `v0 coffee` | `${BUILD_DIR}/coffee/.pid` | Prevents system sleep |
| **Prune Daemon** | (internal) | `${BUILD_DIR}/prune/.daemon.pid` | Cleans stale state |

### Starting/Stopping Workers

```bash
v0 startup              # Start fix, chore, mergeq workers
v0 shutdown             # Stop all workers gracefully
v0 status               # Show worker status
```

### Process Lifecycle

Each worker follows a common pattern:
1. Check PID file exists and process is running (`kill -0 $pid`)
2. If stale PID file (process dead), remove it
3. Start new process via `nohup` with output to log file
4. Write new PID to PID file

See: [v0-startup](commands/v0-startup.md), [v0-shutdown](commands/v0-shutdown.md)

## Directory Structure

### Project-Local Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `${V0_ROOT}/` | Project root (contains `.v0.rc`) |
| `${V0_ROOT}/.v0/` | Local build state (gitignored) |
| `${V0_ROOT}/.v0/build/` | `BUILD_DIR` - operations, workers, queues |
| `${V0_ROOT}/.v0/build/operations/<name>/` | Per-operation state and logs |
| `${V0_ROOT}/.v0/build/mergeq/` | Merge queue state |
| `${V0_ROOT}/plans/` | Implementation plans (git-tracked) |

### Global State Directory

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.local/state/v0/` | Per-project state |
| `~/.local/state/v0/${PROJECT}/` | `V0_STATE_DIR` - project-specific |
| `~/.local/state/v0/${PROJECT}/workspace/` | Workspace for merge operations |
| `~/.local/state/v0/${PROJECT}/tree/` | Feature worktrees |
| `~/.local/state/v0/standalone/` | Standalone chore worker state |

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.v0.rc` | Project configuration |
| `state.json` | Operation state (per-operation) |
| `queue.json` | Merge queue entries |
| `.daemon.pid` | Worker process ID |
| `daemon.log` | Worker output log |

## Environment Variables

### Required (set by `.v0.rc`)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PROJECT` | Project identifier | `"myproject"` |
| `ISSUE_PREFIX` | Wok issue prefix | `"proj"` |

### Computed (set by `v0_load_config`)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `V0_ROOT` | Project root directory | (from `.v0.rc` location) |
| `V0_STATE_DIR` | Global state directory | `~/.local/state/v0/${PROJECT}` |
| `BUILD_DIR` | Build state directory | `${V0_ROOT}/.v0/build` |
| `PLANS_DIR` | Plans directory | `${V0_ROOT}/plans` |
| `REPO_NAME` | Repository name | `$(basename ${V0_ROOT})` |

### Configurable (in `.v0.rc`)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `V0_DEVELOP_BRANCH` | Target branch for merges | `"main"` |
| `V0_WORKSPACE_MODE` | `"worktree"` or `"clone"` | (auto-detected) |
| `V0_GIT_REMOTE` | Git remote name | `"origin"` |
| `V0_FEATURE_BRANCH` | Feature branch pattern | `"feature/{name}"` |
| `V0_BUGFIX_BRANCH` | Bugfix branch pattern | `"fix/{id}"` |
| `V0_CHORE_BRANCH` | Chore branch pattern | `"chore/{id}"` |
| `V0_WORKTREE_INIT` | Hook to run in new worktrees | (none) |

### Runtime Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `V0_DIR` / `V0_INSTALL_DIR` | v0 installation directory |
| `V0_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Workspace path for merge operations |
| `MERGEQ_DIR` | Merge queue directory |
| `DAEMON_PID_FILE` | Current daemon's PID file |
| `DAEMON_LOG_FILE` | Current daemon's log file |

## Inter-Process Coordination

### File-Based Locking

The merge queue uses file-based locking to prevent concurrent modifications:

```
${MERGEQ_DIR}/.queue.lock
```

- Lock acquired with `flock` before queue modifications
- Released immediately after update
- Stale lock detection via PID check

### State Machine Transitions

Operations follow a state machine (see [operations/state.md](operations/state.md)):

```
init → planned → queued → executing → completed → pending_merge → merged
```

State transitions are atomic JSON updates to `state.json`.

### Daemon Coordination

- **Single daemon per project**: PID files prevent duplicate workers
- **Workspace isolation**: Merge operations run in dedicated workspace
- **Queue serialization**: Only one merge processes at a time

### Tmux Sessions

Feature operations run in tmux sessions:

| Session Pattern | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `v0-${PROJECT}-${name}-feature` | Feature development |
| `v0-${PROJECT}-fix-worker` | Fix worker |
| `v0-${PROJECT}-chore-worker` | Chore worker |
| `v0-${PROJECT}-merge-${branch}` | Conflict resolution |

### Event Hooks

Claude Code hooks in `packages/hooks/` handle session events:
- `stop-fix.sh` - Fix worker completion
- `stop-feature.sh` - Feature completion
- `notify-progress.sh` - Progress notifications

## Critical Path: Main Repo vs Workspace

When running from a workspace (worktree or clone), certain paths must point to the main repository:

| Variable | Must Point To | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| `MERGEQ_DIR` | Main repo | Single queue shared across worktrees |
| `BUILD_DIR` | Main repo | State files live in main repo's `.v0/` |
| `V0_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Workspace | Git operations run here |

The function `v0_find_main_repo()` resolves the main repository from any worktree.

See: [WORKSPACE.md](WORKSPACE.md) for detailed workspace architecture.
