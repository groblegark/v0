#
# This module provides:
# - Schema version and log rotation constants
# - State file path construction
# - Transition rules
# - Terminal phase detection

# Requires: BUILD_DIR to be set (via v0_load_config)

# ============================================================================
# Schema Versioning
# ============================================================================
# Current schema version - increment when state.json format changes
# v2: Removed after/blocked_phase/eager fields, blocking via wok only
SM_STATE_VERSION=2

# ============================================================================
# Log Rotation Settings
# ============================================================================
# Maximum log file size before rotation (100KB)
SM_LOG_MAX_SIZE=102400
# Number of rotated logs to keep
SM_LOG_KEEP_COUNT=3

# ============================================================================
# State Transition Table
# ============================================================================
# From State      -> Allowed Transitions
# -------------------------------------------
# init            -> planned, failed
# planned         -> queued, failed
# queued          -> executing, failed
# executing       -> completed, failed, interrupted
# completed       -> pending_merge, merged, failed
# pending_merge   -> merged, conflict, failed
# merged          -> (terminal)
# failed          -> init, planned, queued (on resume)
# conflict        -> pending_merge (on retry), failed
# interrupted     -> init, planned, queued (on resume)
# cancelled       -> (terminal)
#
# NOTE: blocked phase removed in v2. Blocking is tracked via wok deps.

# ============================================================================
# State File Path
# ============================================================================

# sm_get_state_file <op>
